The website is one of the most awesome parts of WAC: we show the user just how awesome our conference is, with cool information, cool effects, and even cooler people. This section of the WAC Documentation will go over how our entire frontend stack works: HTML, CSS, JS, Jekyll, RubyGems, and everything else we use to make our website.

You can find a table of contents of this entire set of documentation on the sidebar, with some dazzling sub-headers. We'll walk you through how to setup up your development environment, learn the basic elements of our system, and understand the nitty gritty of our tech stack.
