The WAC Logo (and its uses) are a key part of our design: they're everywhere, on the website, promotional materials, and on things we give to delegates and speakers! Therefore, it's important to know how to use our logo - and how not to! Minimal Logo \u00b6 This is, in a nutshell, WAC's Logo. By itself, it's visually distinct, and it has a noticeable shape and colour - which makes it easy to spot! When using this logo, try not to mess with its colours or proportions - you shouldn't need to, and it'll interfere with consistency. But, you can resize it as much as you want: its lack of text and crisp, clean edges mean that it can be used at any size. In addition, notice that it doesn't say \"World Affairs Conference\" on it - so while it's a good logo, you shouldn't use it if there's no accompanying text and the reader has no context that the logo is for WAC. While this might seem minor, it's important to keep in mind, as decisions like these separate mediocre design from great design. Black and White Version \u00b6 This is a monochrome, black and white version of the minimal logo. This is useful when the material is being made in only one colour (e.g. pens, cutting down on costs). Full Logo \u00b6 This is essentially the minimal logo accompanied with \"World Affairs Conference\". This logo has a more formal connotation, and is easily understood if the viewer is unfamiliar with the conference.

In addition, many of the templates that WAC builds its design off of were made in specific softwares: in those scenarios, designers will have to use that software. A Note on Software Versioning \u00b6 In the wide majority of cases, WAC will simply use the latest stable version of respective software. However, with some software (most notably Adobe software), this is not feasible from a budgetary or technological perspective. Therefore, we always recommend saving copies of files in backwards-compatible file formats, and coordinating with other members of the design team on software versions. This is especially a problem when handing off files from major Adobe versions, such as Photoshop CC to Photoshop CS5. General Purpose Tools \u00b6 These tools are essential for most designers, mostly because they can perform basic image operations that any designer (graphic, video, web, otherwise) will have to use. Getting familiar with these tools makes the WAC design workflow simple. Adobe Photoshop \u00b6 Photoshop is the definition of a designer's \"Swiss Army Knife\". It's useful in manipulating images, creating quick mockups, and applying special effects to designs. We suggest that any designer gets familiar with Photoshop (or a free alternative, such as GIMP ), as it will pay dividends in the future. Photoshop is often used to create \"one-of\" designs that are minimal in nature, such as Recruitment Posters. For more complicated designs (such as Logos or Packages), we recommend that you use Illustrator or InDesign (whichever is more appropriate). Students can talk to their WAC supervisor to get a license for the Adobe Suite, which includes Photoshop. Adobe Illustrator \u00b6 Illustrator is a good companion to Photoshop, filling in the gaps where Photoshop is lacking. It's useful in creating vectors and other illustrations, and unlike Photoshop it can export to SVG. Knowing the basics of using Illustrator can go a long way in expanding a designer's skills. Illustrator is often used in creating components or more complex designs: we used illustrator in creating logos (Program and Conference), the Program Posters, and minor components of other designs. In addition, many designs can be created in Illustrator and then exported to Photoshop or InDesign. Also, it's used to manipulate SVGs (something that Photoshop cannot do). Colour Picker ( Sip , ColorSnapper 2 , etc.) \u00b6 There are many colour pickers available to download, and WAC doesn't prefer a certain one (*cough* Sip ), but having a colour picker is particularly useful in design - it can ensure that designs follow the WAC style guide, and also grab colour values from other sources. Some colour pickers also allow users to save colour palettes, which is particularly useful for WAC design. Specialist Tools \u00b6 Adobe InDesign \u00b6 InDesign is the software that we use to make complex ready-to-print materials, specifically the Delegate Package and the Nametags. InDesign is great at creating layouts for multi-page designs, using data to generate data-based materials (i.e. nametags), and generally making documents that are ready to print. Using InDesign is a breeze if one is already familiar with Photoshop and/or Illustrator. Adobe Premiere \u00b6 Premiere is the professional video editing software that we use at WAC. We use Premiere not only due to its huge feature-set and its compatibility with other Adobe Software (e.g. After Effects, Audition), but also because all of the computers in UCC's Film Dept. come preloaded with Premiere and are powerful enough to render videos quickly enough. Audacity \u00b6 Audacity is a free and open-source audio editor, which can be a good alternative to Adobe Audition when it's unavailable. Learning to use Audacity is quick and easy, and it's useful in a lot of different applications: for the video, online content, and for the livestream. Code Editor ( Atom , Brackets , Sublime , VSCode ) \u00b6 Coding is a really useful tool skill to have in a wide variety of jobs, and design is no exception. All of web design/development hinges on using code, and coding also comes in handy when manipulating swathes of data or doing checks on human work. While WAC doesn't have a preferred editor (for real this time), there is a plethora of editors available online. Since most of our work is with web development and light data work, your editor needs to support Python, HTML/CSS, and Javascript. GitHub Desktop \u00b6 GitHub Desktop is an open-source visual Git client made by GitHub. Since we use GitHub extensively at WAC , having a Git client can help simplify the coding workflow and make adopting version control easier. Nik Collection \u00b6 The Nik Collection is a super useful (albeit niche) free piece of software that can make photos more vibrant. We've used the Nik Collection to apply filters on photos used on printed materials. Open Broadcaster Software \u00b6 OBS is the free and open-source software that we use to create the livestream. To find out more about OBS, check out the livestream page . Svgsus \u00b6 Svgsus is a useful tool that helps designers organize and manipulate their SVG libraries (e.g. Font Awesome, Material Design Icons, Octicons).","title":"Tools"},{"location":"Design%20Handbook/The%20Basics/tools/#tools","text":"There isn't a single set of \"must-have\" tools that every designer at WAC needs, but there are sets of tools that make designing easy.

Livestreaming is a very important tool - it broadens the accessibility of WAC, especially to those who don't live in Toronto. While it seems daunting, setting up the livestream is actually relatively simple - it just has a lot of moving parts. No prior technical skills are required, though familiarity with livestreaming and design are recommended. The Technology Stack \u00b6 There are three layers of technology at work in the livestream: the input layer, where input audio and video is captured, the processing layer, where audio and video is processed for output, and the output layer, where the video is uploaded to a streaming service and shown to the public. In practice, one or two people can manage the entire livestream, including all three of these layers. Let's break it down at each step. Input Layer \u00b6 The input layer is the capturing of any live audio and video. Typically, this is accomplished with a camera, a microphone, and tapping into a sound system (e.g. Laidlaw Hall). The inputs are then fed to the processing layer, with added visual aids and sound effects. Equipment \u00b6 While there aren't any exact peripherals required to create the input layer, WAC (and UCC) already has infrastructure for the input layer, so we recommend that you start from there. Item Type Example Item Item Description Where to get Camera Canon EOS 5DS This camera is the input video feed. For whatever camera used, ensure that there are sufficient batteries and that the camera can film video for as long as needed. UCC Film Dept. Tripod Tripod A tripod should be used for a static shot (e.g. one of Laidlaw Hall). UCC Film Dept. Video Interface* Canon EOS Utility + Camera Live Converts input feed from the camera into digital video sent to the computer. EOS Utility , Camera Live Audio Interface Audient iD14 Collects all input audio (e.g. line in from Laidlaw Hall Booth, line in from microphone, other computers) into one digital signal sent to a computer. UCC Film Dept. Notes \u00b6 Most of the work for the input layer is just setup work - go to the venue an hour or so in advance, set up the tripod, focus the camera, and connect the audio interface to the audio source(s). During the actual event, if everything is set up properly, the only action that needs to be done is to check on the camera's battery. Setting up the video interface is the most complicated part of input layer, as it's relatively unreliable software-wise. Use the EOS Utility and its drivers to preview the video feed from the camera, and then use Camera Live to create a Syphon server that the processing layer can tap into. If you use a non-Canon camera, we don't have a tested solution for you - beware! Processing Layer \u00b6 The processing layer's job is to take these inputs and stitch them together with other visuals to create an uploadable final product. The entire processing layer is software-based and happens on one computer, which makes things both convenient and hectic. However, with experience, it becomes very simple. The central hub for the processing layer is the broadcasting software. We highly recommend using Open Broadcaster Software (OBS) , a production-ready open-source broadcasting software that's used by professional streamers and by our livestreaming crew. OBS is pretty intuitive to use, and our use case is rather light, but if you want to familiarize yourself with the software the internet has a plethora of resources on using and configuring it. Since the processing layer is the most skill-intensive part of the livestream, we strongly recommend that you do a practice run of the livestream - it can spot problems that are likely to happen during the livestream and familiarizes the software with you. Video Source \u00b6 This section will assume that you're using a Canon camera + EOS Utility + Camera Live with OBS on a Mac running OSX. There are other ways to do this on different platforms, but they are untested. Here's a step-by-step guide to creating an OBS Video Source of the camera feed. Connect the camera to your computer via USB. Open up EOS Utility, and preview the video feed. * If the preview fails, try re-installing EOS Utility and its drivers. Open up Camera Live, and select your connected camera. * If Camera Live doesn't recognize any cameras, close everything and start again. * If Camera Live errors, try restarting it and/or EOS Utility. In OBS, create a new Game Capture/Syphon source, with Camera Live's Syphon process as the input source. The newly-created source should now be usable in any scenes. The video source is by far the most unreliable and frustrating part of the livestreaming process, so be patient. Audio Source \u00b6 Creating different audio inputs for OBS is quite simple - just add an Audio Source through the OBS menu, and make sure that your levels are managed! A quick note on music: most streaming services, such as Twitch and Facebook, will mute parts of your content for containing copyrighted music. We recommend muting any music sources in OBS, or else parts of the video will be muted. Secondary Visual Content \u00b6 Often times, presenters will have additional A/V needs (e.g. a video or audio). There are three different ways that you can put this content into the livestream: Pan the camera to the A/V content, and tap into the audio through the audio interface is needed. Take a digital line in of the A/V content from its source (e.g. the Laidlaw Hall computer) Create a copy of the A/V content on the processing computer, and then use a Window Capture source to listen in on the content. Tips and Tricks \u00b6 There are simple things that you can do to make the stream better: Add visual information (in the form of images), such as our logo, social media, programs Use multiple scenes with different presets and transitions to smoothly switch between different types of content (e.g. going from a close-up to a wide shot of the entire room) Before and after the stream, show content instead of an empty podium (i.e. the WAC Video) Monitor the output audio with headphones - it's important to know what the stream will sound like. Sample Stream Schedule \u00b6 Here's what a stream schedule would look like for the keynote event. Time Stream Action ~ 15 minutes before event start Turn on stream, project a still image of WAC and our speaker's topic and/or a video of the venue, and play non-copyrighted music ~ 3 minutes before event start Transition to WAC Video on stream Keynote start Transition to close-up of podium, key in podium audio with audio interface Introduction of speaker Zoom out and pan to speaker going to podium, mute podium audio Speaker start Transition to two-visual setup (both the speaker's slides and a video of the speaker on the podium), key in podium audio Q&A Session Zoom out and pan to general view of venue, key in Q&A microphone audio Thanking speaker Zoom out and pan to the venue End of event Project still image with program details of tomorrow's event, play non-copyrighted music Output Layer \u00b6 After the processing layer has done its work, there is now one completed video and audio stream that is ready to be shown to the public. The output layer uploads this video stream to the respective streaming service (e.g. Facebook, Twitter/Periscope, YouTube). Generally, this step is pretty easy (as each video stream vendor will have instructions on how to configure OBS to output to their stream). Typically, it involves creating a stream key on the vendor's site, inputting that into OBS' \"Stream\" menu, and selecting the correct service to stream. For WAC 2018, we streamed to Facebook Live simply due to ease of access, but video can be streamed to many different services. Here are some links that explain how to send the output to various vendors: Facebook Live ( Tutorial from FB Live , Tutorial from OBS ) (make sure to use the WAC FB Page) Youtube ( Tutorial from Youtube ) Twitter/Periscope ( Tutorial from Periscope )","title":"Livestream"},{"location":"Design%20Handbook/The%20Design%20Lifecycle/livestream/#livestream","text":"The livestream is a relatively new portion of WAC that was started in WAC 2018, where we livestreamed Professor Geoffrey Hinton's Keynote Address to Facebook (as well as some of the programs during the day).

During the actual event, if everything is set up properly, the only action that needs to be done is to check on the camera's battery. Setting up the video interface is the most complicated part of input layer, as it's relatively unreliable software-wise.

The entire processing layer is software-based and happens on one computer, which makes things both convenient and hectic. However, with experience, it becomes very simple. The central hub for the processing layer is the broadcasting software. We highly recommend using Open Broadcaster Software (OBS) , a production-ready open-source broadcasting software that's used by professional streamers and by our livestreaming crew. OBS is pretty intuitive to use, and our use case is rather light, but if you want to familiarize yourself with the software the internet has a plethora of resources on using and configuring it. Since the processing layer is the most skill-intensive part of the livestream, we strongly recommend that you do a practice run of the livestream - it can spot problems that are likely to happen during the livestream and familiarizes the software with you.","title":"Processing Layer"},{"location":"Design%20Handbook/The%20Design%20Lifecycle/livestream/#video-source","text":"This section will assume that you're using a Canon camera + EOS Utility + Camera Live with OBS on a Mac running OSX. There are other ways to do this on different platforms, but they are untested. Here's a step-by-step guide to creating an OBS Video Source of the camera feed. Connect the camera to your computer via USB. Open up EOS Utility, and preview the video feed. * If the preview fails, try re-installing EOS Utility and its drivers. Open up Camera Live, and select your connected camera. * If Camera Live doesn't recognize any cameras, close everything and start again. * If Camera Live errors, try restarting it and/or EOS Utility. In OBS, create a new Game Capture/Syphon source, with Camera Live's Syphon process as the input source. The newly-created source should now be usable in any scenes. The video source is by far the most unreliable and frustrating part of the livestreaming process, so be patient.","title":"Video Source"},{"location":"Design%20Handbook/The%20Design%20Lifecycle/livestream/#audio-source","text":"Creating different audio inputs for OBS is quite simple - just add an Audio Source through the OBS menu, and make sure that your levels are managed!

The output layer uploads this video stream to the respective streaming service (e.g. Facebook, Twitter/Periscope, YouTube). Generally, this step is pretty easy (as each video stream vendor will have instructions on how to configure OBS to output to their stream). Typically, it involves creating a stream key on the vendor's site, inputting that into OBS' \"Stream\" menu, and selecting the correct service to stream. For WAC 2018, we streamed to Facebook Live simply due to ease of access, but video can be streamed to many different services.

All of the nametags are templated in InDesign, generated with Data Merge, and then exported to PDF and printed. Nametag design is relatively simple (as they don't change year by year and most of the heavy lifting comes from computing), but it's important to look out for edge cases, such as spelling errors, non-Unicode characters, and cutoff text. While making the nametags can be arduous, those who are experienced with InDesign can make them very quickly. As such, nametags tend to be a one-person job - but that one person needs to have a basic understanding of coding (to collect the data) as well as an eye for design (to make and produce the nametags). Examples \u00b6 Data Collection \u00b6 Before any designing can be done, all the data for the nametags needs to be centralized into one file. Typically, registration information from WAC is sprawled across different sources ( our registration system , emails, UCC and BH, etc.). Assembling together all of this information by hand is glaringly inefficient (and often leads to mistakes); thus, the best way to ensure that all the files are formatted correctly and put all into one place is through the magic of computers! This page won't delve too deep into the specifics (as the process will vary from year to year), but typically data collection consists of a few lightweight scripts (in a language like Python) that pull data from all of the different sources, format them, and validate each of the sources. Then, they assign the plenaries for each delegate, and export all the required data to an output CSV (ready to use with InDesign). You can find some sample code we've used in previous years in the WAC scripts repository . A Quick Note On Plenary Assignments \u00b6 Assigning plenaries to delegates tends to be a headache, especially with the restrictions that speakers and facilities can put on plenaries. In the past, we've had hiccups every year when programatically assigning plenaries, but the error rate has gone down and down. In theory, it is perfectly possible to write a program that correctly assigns all plenaries - we suggest that future WAC programmers keep on iterating on the scripts we use at WAC. As a reminder, unless the structure of WAC registration changes, delegates receive 4 preference slots and are assigned three plenaries. As each plenary exists in two timeslots and are paired (e.g. 2 plenaries are in the first and second timeslot, 2 plenaries are in the first and third timeslot, and 2 plenaries are in the second and third timeslot), every delegate should receive a set of assignments that is within their preferences. The challenge tends to come with balancing room numbers and fire codes - often times one plenary at WAC is overwhelmingly more popular than others, which leads into logistics issues. We recommend that you solve this problem outside of code (e.g. putting popular plenaries in big venues), but if you must solve it with code then you have to have situations where delegates' preferences aren't met. Data Merge \u00b6 Data Merge is a powerful tool in Adobe InDesign that allows you to create a template file and export many copies of that file, with data populated from an input source. We use Data Merge to generate our nametags from information in an excel spreadsheet. File Type \u00b6 To use Data Merge, the input file needs to have the right file type. We recommend using either Comma Separated Values .csv file (which can be exported from Excel or Google Sheets), or a UTF-16 Unicode Text .txt file (which can be exported from Excel). Usually, a CSV is fine, but if the nametag values contain special characters (e.g. \u00e9, \u00e7, \u00fc) then you must use UTF-16 Unicode encoding to maintain the special characters. Format \u00b6 Data Merge interprets different types of values (e.g. School, Name, Position) by a header row, where each column is a specific type of data. Then, select the Data Merge option in InDesign, and use \"Select Data Source\" to select your data. The resulting menu should show each of the data types you had. Layout \u00b6 To use these data types, simply create text boxes and type in <<Type Name>> . You can also double-click the data type in the Data Merge menu to automatically put it into the document. This text is manipulatable like any other text. While designing layouts using Data Merge, keep in mind the length of the possible data values: for long data such as delegate or school names, sufficient space is needed to allow the text to wrap into multiple lines. If not, some names will be cut off, which isn't fun for anybody! If space allows, we suggest that you turn off hyphenation for text blocks, as they can be visually jarring and confusing. You can do this in the paragraph menu. Generating and Exporting \u00b6 You can preview how a generated document by selecting \"Preview\", or use \"Create Merged Document\" to create an InDesign document with a spread for each set (row) of your data. To create a final document to print, click \"Export to PDF\". The wide majority of settings are unimportant, though there are a few tidbits that are: Enable \"Generate Overset Text Report\" - this allows you to see if there's any overset text Use Single Record per Document Page, as our document is set up for one nametag per spread. Merge All Records - there's no reason not to! The \"High Quality Print\" Preset is usually sufficient, though you can fiddle around with the settings if needed. After exporting, you should have a PDF that you can send to print. We suggest that you take a cursory look through some of the nametags, just to be sure that there aren't any problems.","title":"Nametags"},{"location":"Design%20Handbook/The%20Design%20Lifecycle/nametags/#nametags","text":"","title":"Nametags"},{"location":"Design%20Handbook/The%20Design%20Lifecycle/nametags/#overview","text":"We print three different kinds of nametags: delegate nametags, which are double-sided and have each delegate's information on them, faculty nametags, which are single-sided and have just the school name, and staff nametags, which are also single-sided and have the staff position.
